benchmark.txt contains output of Sergey's GID, http://x-server.gmca.aps.anl.gov/cgi/www_form.exe?template=GID_sl_multilay_simplified.htm&method=post

GaAs 400, 10 keV symmetric, sigma pol.
No additional Debye-Waller factors

Here is what was enetered:

t = 20000 da/a = 1e-4 code = GaAs

Note that this is a 2 um thick uniformly strained crystal on top of a 1 um unstrained substrate.  

This benchmark is of interest because it has much higher strains than previously tested. It also has higher accuracy (smaller maximum step sizes), and corrected unstrained calculations. The output runs required approximately 10  seconds on my Chromebook, 400 angular points.
