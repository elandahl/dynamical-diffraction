benchmark.txt contains output of Sergey's GID, http://x-server.gmca.aps.anl.gov/cgi/www_form.exe?template=GID_sl_multilay_simplified.htm&method=post

GaAs 400, 10 keV symmetric, sigma pol.
No additional Debye-Waller factors

Here is what was enetered:

t = 10000 da/a = 1e-4 code = GaAs

Note that this is a 1 um thick uniformly strained crystal on top of a 1 um unstrained substrate.  

This benchmark is of interest because it has much higher strains than previously tested.  The output runs required < 2 seconds on my Chromebook, 100 angular points.
